		SESSION 1 : ASSIGNMENT 1

1. Various sources of Big Data

The various sources of big data are 
(i)Social media    :Twitter,LinkedIn,Facebook
(ii)Sensor data    :Medical devices,car sensors
(iii)Public web     :Government,weather
(iv)Business apps :Intranets,portals 
(v)Data storage   :SQL,NoSQL,hadoop


2. 3 V's of Big data 

(i)Data Velocity: Realtime,Periodic,Batch
(ii)Data Volume:MB,TB,PB
(iii)Data Variety:unstructured,structured,both


3. Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling

Vertical Scaling-
It is a process of adding more CPU power and storage resource to a single instance.
Advantage     :There is no need to manage multiple instance, as all data is in a single machine. 
Disadvantage:The cost efficiency is a major problem.

Horizontal Scaling-
It is process of dividing the data set and distributing the data over multiple servers, or shards.
Advantage   :All of your data is in smaller chunks so program can process them very fast with parallel job
                     distribution among all instance.
Disadvantage:Managing instances and the complex distributed architecture.


4. Need and Working of Hadoop

Need of Hadoop:
(i)Hadoop software library, which is a framework, plays a vital role in handling Big Data. 
(ii)Apache Hadoop enables surplus data to be streamlined for any distributed processing system across clusters of computers
using simple programming models.

Working of Hadoop:
It contains of 2 componentsnamely,
(i) HDFS: This is used as storage. It writes data once to the server and then reads and reuses it many times. 
(ii)Mapreduce:This is basically used for processing of huge data.
